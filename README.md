Training project: Task Management System
========================================

> [!NOTE]
> This project is designed as an educational assignment for students who are learning to code.

This project serves as a practical implementation of fundamental Python programming concepts including data structures,
file I/O operations, user input handling, and basic data manipulation.
It is specifically designed as a learning exercise for students to apply their programming knowledge in a real-world
scenario while developing essential software development skills.

### Project Descriptions

It is a console-based task management system designed for small projects. The system allows users to create, update,
delete, and view tasks through an interactive command-line interface.

### Features

- **Task Management**: Create, view, update, and delete tasks
- **Task Properties**: Each task includes a title, description, priority level, status, and unique identifier
- **Data Persistence**: All task data is stored in a text file for persistence between sessions
- **Sorting Capabilities**: Sort tasks by priority or status
- **Search Functionality**: Search for tasks by keywords in titles or descriptions

### Task Properties

- **Title**: A brief name for the task
- **Description**: Detailed information about the task
- **Priority**: Can be low, medium, or high
- **Status**: Can be new, in progress, or completed
- **ID**: Automatically assigned unique identifier
